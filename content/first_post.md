##Big Heading for a Big Day

This isthe first paragraph of our article - huzzah!

We're writing this in Markdown format so we can use two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text. 

###A Slightly Smaller Header

We can also use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italicized* word.
